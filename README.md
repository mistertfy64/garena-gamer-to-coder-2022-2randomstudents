# Essay on my (mistertfy64)'s thought process for design and content choices + Acknowledgements.

## Content
When the competition was announced, the theme for the website was `Garena's BlockMan Go` and `Event`. I basically thought to myself that what would be a good (fictional) event for BlockMan Go? Then, it came to my mind (idk how) that I should replicate the actual event's (i.e., the event that told me to make this) content, with prizes, other cool stuff for reaching a high rank, and of course, a satisfactory/participation acknowledgement

### Story
I honestly couldn't think of a decent story, so I just used the overused story, a (insert thing here) is destroyed, the (insert high tier here) needs your help, and offers you a reward. Couldn't think of anything else. My teammate (EpicCatto) seems to like it (but i dont have proof nor 100% memory that he actually did).

### 1st place reward being 200 times 2nd place's
Well, the reason I set the reward for first place is that I actually got the inspiration for the massive-first-place-reward-compared-to-runner-ups from money/death movies. These movies usually revolve around a deadly competition with an unbelievable prize for the winner, along with a mysterious being/organization behind it.

The "Judges" got the `mysterious organization` ticked off, and the 1 billion baht prize for the winner ticks the `unbelievable prize` off. Although the winner would only be rewarded (up to) 650 million baht due to taxes. Didn't think of that...

Additionally, many competitons (both fictional and non-fictional) also have exclusive rewards for first place. For example, National Software Contest (which I participated in years ago), has a trophy for the first place, and nothing cool for second place or third place. Ficitonal shows don't have anything "special" other than getting called the winner/still getting to live/etc.

## Design
Anyways, while Garena really did give permission to their assets from BlockMan go for use, I still think it's correct to credit them. Additionally, no competition will give a 1 billion baht cash prize (especially if its a virtual one with no penalty for losing). Because of that, I wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of each page, along with me and EpicCatto's social media links(???).

### Why monospaced text?
Because there's a 1 billion baht cash prize through this (fictional) competition, the opening should also be good. So I added a splash screen on top of it. This splash screen gives off the "corrupted" text vibe, with characters being replaced. If it wasn't monospaced, the text would just shake as the corrupted characters get replaced in to actual ones.

### Why so many effects?
I didn't add them, Catto added them. I (and possibly him) personally don't think it's **that** distracting. Also it makes the website look cooler.
